#summary The roadmap of Doom!
#labels roadmap

= Roadmap for 1.0 =

Feature goals
  * _DONE_ Fully-supported pipe metaphor: inputs, filters, outputs.
  * Inputs: 
    * _DONE_ file
    * exec
    * _DONE_ amqp
    * stomp
    * syslog
    * tcp
  * Input variations: file+json, etc. (will be filters)
  * Filters
    * _DONE_ grok
    * something grep-like
    * something sed-like
    * json
  * Outputs
    * _DONE_ stdout
    * _DONE_ amqp
    * stomp
    * tcp
    * syslog
    * _DONE_ mongodb
    * _DONE_ elasticsearch
    * _DONE_ websockets
  * A default search web interface - elasticsearch only (for 1.0)
  * Basic real-time search web interface through websockets.
  * Be stable with 10k events/sec going through the system of file input -> amqp -> elasticsearch on reasonably-modern hardware. See [KnownPerformanceIssues]

Supported/documented configurations:
  * standalone: local files through to elasticsearch
  * piped: local files to amqp, amqp to a filter to amqp, amqp to elasticsearch

Code quality
  * Logstash agents should be debuggable through logging.
  * Each component (input/output/filter) must have tests.
  * Agent must have tests.

Documentation goals
  * ElasticSearch indexes, etc, should be automatically configured by logstash.
  * Configuration: tags, inputs, outputs, filters, etc.
  * Document how to configure elasticsearch. Indexing, sharding, mapping, etc.
  * Document best practices
  * Consistent terminology ("input", "output", "event", "filter", etc).

= > 1.0 =

(This list is unprioritized)

* Multi-line event support (will be a filter)
* More grok patterns (java stacktrace, etc)
* "nearby" log event query (i.e. find events near a stacktrace)
* Saved queries
* Customizable reports
* Schedulable queries
* Users, accounting, search data protection (hide certain results from some users, etc)
* Better visuals: More than just histograms on search hits.
* Suggested field values in a query
