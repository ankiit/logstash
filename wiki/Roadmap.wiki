#summary The roadmap of Doom!

= Roadmap for 1.0 =

Feature goals
  * Fully-supported pipe metaphor: inputs, filters, outputs.
  * Inputs: file, exec, amqp, stomp, syslog, tcp
  * Input variations: file+json, etc.
  * Filters: grok, something grep-like, something sed-like
  * Outputs: stdout, amqp, stomp, tcp, syslog, mongodb, elasticsearch, websockets
  * A default search web interface - elasticsearch only (for 1.0)
  * Basic real-time search web interface through websockets.
  * Be stable with 10k events/sec going through the system of file input -> amqp -> elasticsearch

Supported configurations:
  * standalone: local files through to elasticsearch
  * piped: local files to amqp, amqp to a filter to amqp, amqp to elasticsearch

Code quality
  * Logstash agents should be debuggable through logging.
  * Each component (input/output/filter) must have tests.
  * Agent must have tests.

Documentation goals
  * ElasticSearch should be automatically configured by logstash.
  * Configuration: tags, inputs, outputs, filters, etc.
  * Document how to configure elasticsearch. Indexing, sharding, mapping, etc.
  * Document best practices


= 2.0 ideas =

* Multi-line file support
* "nearby" log event query (i.e. find events near a stacktrace)
