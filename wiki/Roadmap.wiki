= Roadmap for 1.0 =

Feature goals
  * Fully-supported pipe metaphor: inputs, filters, outputs.
  * Inputs: file, exec, amqp, stomp, syslog
  * Filters: grok, something grep-like, something sed-like
  * Outputs: stdout, amqp, stomp, tcp, syslog, mongodb, elasticsearch, websockets
  * A default search web interface - elasticsearch only (for 1.0)
  * Example code that serves up the websockets
  * Be stable with 10k events/sec going through the system of file input -> amqp -> elasticsearch
  * Tag support

Supported configurations:
  * standalone: local files through to elasticsearch
  * piped: local files to amqp, amqp to a filter to amqp, amqp to elasticsearch

Code quality
  * Logstash agents should be debuggable through logging.
  * Each component (input/output/filter) must have tests.
  * Agent must have tests.

Documentation goals
  * Document how to configure elasticsearch. Indexing, sharding, mapping, etc.
  * Document best practices
