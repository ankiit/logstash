General: JSON over TCP.
Message encoding: [length][message data]

  * length is a 4 byte integer representing the length of the message.
  * message data is plain text json.

:: In the future, we may accept compressed data instead of plain text json
data. The first few bytes of the 'data' portion can be used to determine if the
data is compressed and by what means. However, we do not currently support compression.

== Agent IndexEvent ==

Sender: Agent
Receiver: Indexer

Purpose: Tell the indexer to index a new event.

{{{
{ call: "IndexEvent"
  args: {
    type: <string : log type>,
    message: <string OR object : log data>,
    metadata: {
      source_host: <string : hostname originating the event>
      source_app: <string : app originating the event>
      <other attributes here>
    },
  },
}
}}}

  * "log_type" is the log type. The type can be any type known to the Indexer. Base types include syslog and json.
  * "message" is the contents of the event. It can be a string (ie; line from a logfile) or a full JSON object.
  * metadata contains other attributes relative to this event. At a minimum, the Agent should include the source host and application.
