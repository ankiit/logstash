#summary ruby compatibility

Ruby changes pretty wildly between versions. 

W only officially support ruby 1.8.7 at this time. I'm willing to fix small things and take patches, but 1.9.x is pretty wildly different in many core stdlib (and often undocumented) cases that it's extremely difficult to support.

Here's a table of version-related stuff.

|| Ruby || Component || Works? ||
|| Ruby 1.8.6 || date filter || Not yet. DateTime.parse does not parse ISO8601 times ||
|| Ruby 1.8.7 || date filter || Yes. Tests pass. ||
|| Ruby 1.9.2 || date filter || Not yet. DateTime.sec_fraction means something different than it did in 1.8.7. ||
