#summary ruby compatibility

Ruby changes pretty wildly between versions. Here's a table of support.

|| Ruby || Component || Works? ||
|| Ruby 1.8.6 || date filter || Not yet. DateTime.parse does not parse ISO8601 times ||
|| Ruby 1.8.7 || date filter || Yes. Tests pass. ||
|| Ruby 1.9.2 || date filter || Not yet. DateTime.sec_fraction means something different than it did in 1.8.7. ||
