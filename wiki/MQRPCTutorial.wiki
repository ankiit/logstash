#summary MQRPC Tutorial

= MQPRC Tutorial =

Let's start with a RPC example: Summing up numbers.

You'll need an AMQP server for this. If you don't have one, you can download one. RabbitMQ is pretty easy to get going. If you don't want to set one up, the fine folks at RabbitMQ provide a demo queue server online, see http://www.rabbitmq.com/examples.html#demo-server

== Make your message ==

Messages are generic. For a real RPC system you'll want the function call (a Request) and the function return (a Response).

=== The Add Messages ===
Here's an example of a "Add" request. For demonstrative purposes, we'll give the request an argument called 'numbers' which will store an array of numbers into. Put the following in a file called 'add_message.rb':

{{{
require 'mqrpc'

class AddRequest < MQRPC::RequestMessage
  hashbind :numbers, "/args/numbers"
end

class AddResponse < MQRPC::ResponseMessage
  hashbind :sum, "/args/sum"
end
}}}

We've now created two messages. 

=== The Server ===

{{{
require 'mqrpc'
require 'add_message'

class Adder < MQRPC::Agent
  def AddRequestHandler(message)
    puts "Got #{message.class.name} for #{message.numbers.inspect}"
    sum = message.numbers.reduce { |a,b| a + b }
    
    # Make the response
    response = AddResponse.new
    response.id = message.id
    response.sum = sum
    yield response 
  end # def AddRequestHandler
  
  def run
    subscribe("adder")
    super
  end
end # class Adder < MQRPC::Agent

config = MQRPC::Config.new({ "mqhost" => "dev.rabbitmq.com" })
adder = Adder.new(config)
adder.run
}}}

=== The Client ===

Now let's create the client.

{{{
require 'mqrpc'
require 'add_message'

class AdderClient < MQRPC::Agent
  def run
    request = AddRequest.new
    request.numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]

    # send our request to the 'adder' queue
    # and run the given block for the response
    op = sendmsg("adder", request) do |msg|
      puts "Got result: #{msg.sum}"

      # Say we're done.
      close
    end
    super
  end # def
end # class AdderClient < MQRPC::Agent

config = MQRPC::Config.new({ "mqhost" => "dev.rabbitmq.com" })
adder = AdderClient.new(config)
adder.run
}}}
