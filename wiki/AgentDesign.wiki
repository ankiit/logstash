#summary LogStash Agent Design

= Agent Purpose =

The purpose of agents is to know where and how to get logs and other data into the logstash Indexer.

= Operating Conditions =

 * Don't overload the network: local log bandwidth may become too large to safely transport in real-time over the network
 * Agent must not negatively impact (within reason) with operation of the other services running on the host
 * Multiple Agents may overwhelm a single Indexer. The Indexer should be able redirect Agents to other Indexers.

= Configuration =

 * Agents need to know where logfiles live.
 * Needs to know about log rotation and follow files appropriately.
 * Needs to know who the Indexer servers are

= Sample Config =

Let's use YAML for simplicity.
{{{
---
- /var/log/*
- /var/log/apache2/access.log
}}}

= Smartness =

For simpler configuration, the agent should look for expected log rotation
patterns when a wildcard is given. For example, if it finds 'messages',
'message.0', 'messages.1.gz', etc, it should figure out that the real logfile
is 'messages'.

Do we even want this?
